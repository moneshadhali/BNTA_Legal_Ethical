# Legal and Ethical Standard

## Scenario 1
BankingCorp are one of the leading retail banks in the country, offering a full range of products including current accounts, savings products, credit cards and loans. They have in-depth knowledge of their customers' income, financial commitments and spending habits. They already offer some products where customers can pay a monthly fee and receive benefits in return. Some of these benefits include special offers from a curated list of third-party partners which customers can opt-in to receiving.

They have recently been approached by a payday loan company who want to send direct marketing to users struggling to pay their credit card bills. The loan company want to email the customers they feel would be most likely to use their services but acknowledge that manually identifying targets would be time-consuming and want to develop an algorithm to automate this. BankingCorp have given them access to their systems to test this algorithm, ensuring it works with real customer data. The loan company have had some negative publicity recently and so BankingCorp will not be announcing this new partnership publicly. Instead they will inform customers in an email explaining the changes to their terms and conditions.

#### Response:

**Legal Concerns**
Banking Corp is violating the GDPR (2018) privacy laws and regulations by sharing customer data to third party company without explicitly getting their consents fro, their user (confedentiality breach)

**Ethical Concerns**
Banking Corp are not being transparent about using user data (getting informed consent) - only manipulating the user to agree to policy (terms and condition) that they have not directly signed up for. Usually majority of user do not read the terms and condition due to it being a long document (most skip and trust the companies integrity) thereby manipulating the user to sign up for something that they might not want to disclose.
Banking Corp is breaking the anonymity claus by giving their personal info  to the loan company thereby allowing their vulnerable user to be expolited.

**Possible Steps Company Can do:**
Get the user direct permission and being transparent about the usage of user data.
Consider features and usage of user data from the user POV (ethical standard being met)
Have an ethical team to inspect companies decision and stop possible malpractice or exploitation.
